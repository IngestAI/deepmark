# Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is expected to contribute approximately $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, according to a <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/data-and-analytics/publications/artificial-intelligence-study.html" target="_blank">recent study by PwC</a>. As AI continues to play a crucial role in various domains, Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLM) have emerged as a powerful building block in creating AI-powered applications capable of generating enormous business value and generative AI is the key element in these kinds of applications.

# Why are We Doing This? - Problem Statement

AI sparked a revolution in the last decade and now AI Subject Matter Experts at MIT (<a href="https://horizon.mit.edu/about-us" target="_blank">https://horizon.mit.edu/about-us</a>) believe that Generative AI is going to further transform several domains such as code development, chatbots, audio/video amongst many others. With the advancement of Generative AI companies such as openAI and their products such as ChatGPT, there are legal, ethical and trust issues with Gen AI. These challenges beg the need for a good assessment of the products including metrics that need to aim to improve or rank these various models that drive the overall technology. This is also a roadblock for adaptation of GenAI in several companies today.

According to <a href="https://hbr.org/2023/06/managing-the-risks-of-generative-ai" target="_blank">recent HBR report</a>: Generative AI cannot operate on a set-it-and-forget-it basis — the tools need constant oversight.

Although assessment metrics are clearly defined and intrinsic metrics are normally assessed almost instantly when an LLM model is released, there’s no available tools (open-source or proprietary) that enable developers to seamlessly make task-specific (intrinsic) assessments on their unique data. The only solution close to it is the LangChain LangSmith, which is still in closed beta and is not mature enough to provide comprehensive extrinsic metrics that are essential for adoption.

In summary, organizations need to be able to assess LLM models on their own data to deliver verifiable results that balance accuracy, precision, recall (the model’s ability to correctly identify positive cases within a given dataset), and reliability, as models can produce different answers to the same prompts, impeding the user’s ability to assess the accuracy of outputs.

# Our Solution

To address this challenge of reliability, we (IngestAI Labs) have developed Deepmark AI - a benchmarking tool that enables assessment of large language models (LLM) on various extrinsic (task-specific) metrics on your own data. It has pre-built integration with leading Generative AI APIs such as GPT-4, Anthropic, GPT-3.5 Turbo, Cohere, AI21, and others. 

Current GenAI (LLM) Assessment Metrics

When it comes to assessing the performance of LLMs, there are two main types of metrics that can be used: intrinsic and extrinsic.

Examples of intrinsic metrics include, but they are not limited to
- Entropy,
- Perplexity,
- Coherence, etc.

Extrinsic metrics, or also called Task-Specific metrics, may include:
- Accuracy,
- Latency,
- Cost, etc.

These assessment metrics are not exhaustive, and specific applications may have additional or alternative metrics depending on the context and requirements, but some of the task-specific metrics like latency, accuracy, or cost can be considered as the most commonly used.

Deepmark AI enables a unique testing environment for language models (LLM), allowing GenAI developers to easily diagnose inaccuracies and performance issues in a matter of seconds. By using Deepmark AI,  Generative AI applications developers can run multiple LLM models on hundreds or thousands of iterations over specific tasks (question-answering, sentiment analysis, NER, etc) and get exact assessment results in seconds.

DeepMark AI is a tool specifically designed for Generative AI builders.This solution focuses on iterative assessment of extrinsic (task-specific) metrics to identify most predictable, reliable, and cost-effective Generative AI models based on the unique needs of a particular use case. Deepmark AI offers capabilities for comprehensive assessment of various important GenAI performance metrics, such as:

- Question answering accuracy
- Text classification accuracy
- PII recognition accuracy
- Named entity recognition (NER) accuracy
- Summarization quality (Relevance)
- Sentiment analysis accuracy
- Cost analysis
- Failure rate
- Accuracy
- Latency

Deepmark AI empowers developers and organizations to make informed decisions when navigating through the most important performance metrics of Large Language Models.

**User Adoption:**

Since its launch in February 2023, IngestAI Labs plantorm (Playground, AI Aggregator, App Builder) has quickly gained popularity as a community-driven platform for rapid exploration, experimentation, and rapid prototyping of various AI use cases.

The platform has gained a significant industry recognition:
- StartX AI Series,
- ProductHunt Product #1 of the Day,
- Accelerated by the PLUGandPLAY Silicon Valley program, and
- Backed by the Cohere Acceleration Program.

In less than one year, IngestAI has amassed an impressive user base of over 40,000 individuals, with nearly 15,000 active users on a monthly basis and few NASDAQ-traded companies among customers and in the pipeline. This level of traction speaks to the platform's ability to attract and engage users and generate business value.
